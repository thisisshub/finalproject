    '''Returns a tuple of lists in the form (highs, lows, ranges, averages) with stats for player 0's performance against player 1
    Each list is in the form [wins, losses, ties], and the names are pretty self-explanatory.
    For example, highs is a list of the most amount of wins, losses, and ties it achieved across any round.

    players: a tuple in the form (player 0, player 1) where both are Player objects
    start_game: an instance of a Game (or Game subclass) that the players should start at for each game they play
    rounds: the number of rounds the players will play against each other
    games_per_round: how many games are played per round
    randomize_first_player: whether or not to randomize who goes first
    is_initial_state: whether or not the start_game is in its initial state (if False, randomizing the first player may take longer)
    comment: how verbose the print statements are; higher integers give more print statements
    pct_increment: how much the percentage should increase by when it prints out
